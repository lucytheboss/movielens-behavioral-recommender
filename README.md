# Movielens Behavioral Recommender

This project investigates how user rating behavior, exposure bias, and temporal dynamics influence the performance and fairness of movie recommendation systems.

Using the MovieLens 25M dataset, I analyze behavioral patterns in user–item interactions and evaluate how standard recommender models amplify or mitigate these patterns. Rather than optimizing solely for prediction accuracy, this study emphasizes interpretability, bias analysis, and user-centric failure modes.
